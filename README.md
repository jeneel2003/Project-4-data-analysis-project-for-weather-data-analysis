# Weather Data Analysis

**Weather Data Analysis** is a comprehensive data analytics project where we explore and analyze weather conditions using Python and its powerful data manipulation library, **Pandas**. This project is designed to help beginners and intermediate learners develop practical skills in Python-based data analysis by working with real-world time-series weather data.

The dataset used in this project provides hourly data on various weather parameters like temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, and atmospheric pressure. Through this project, you will learn how to:
- Load and preprocess large datasets efficiently.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using **Pandas**.
- Answer specific weather-related queries using filtering, grouping, and statistical functions.
- Handle and clean data by detecting missing values and renaming columns.
- Generate insights from data by computing key metrics such as mean, variance, and standard deviation.

Some of the key questions answered in this project include:
- What are the unique wind speed values?
- How many times was the weather exactly clear?
- What is the mean visibility and standard deviation of pressure?

All code is organized in a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to follow and replicate. The project also includes examples of filtering data based on conditions, using both **AND** and **OR** logical operators.

For a more detailed walkthrough and visual explanation of the project, you can check out the video tutorial on the **Data Science Lovers** YouTube channel, which provides step-by-step guidance:
